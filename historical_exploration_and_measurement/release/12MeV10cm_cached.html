            <h3>Bivariate spline fit for interpolation purposes</h3>
                        
            <p>Below is the bivariate spline fit formed using the parameters <i>width</i> and <i>equivalent perimeter on area</i>.
            For ease of use the results are plotted with respect to <i>length</i> and <i>width</i>. The valid fitting region is given as a
            colourwash. The colour of the colourwash is representative of the fitted cutout factor.</p>
            
            <p>Hovering your mouse over the righthand plot will give the cutout factor results in the <i>z</i> parameter.
            Where the <i>z</i> paramater returns null, and there is no colour wash, is not a valid fitting region. This
            may be due either to not having enough points in the direct vicinity, or the region being outside the external data 
            boundary.</p>
            
            <p>Hovering your mouse over the lefthand plot will provide you with a way to lookup individual measured data points.
            Your measured data is given in blue. The equivalent shape with <i>width</i> and <i>length</i> inverted is given in orange.</p>
