## Description
The methodology this code employs is currently undergoing peer review. Any use of the code accepts the AGPL3+ license which includes no warranty that this code is fit for a particular purpose. Attempts have been made to make the code transparent and it is recommended that an experienced python programmer who understands the procedure and requirements of your centre identifies whether or not the code is fit for your use.

Seeing as currently the very methodology this code is based on is still undergoing peer review I would recommend any implementation of this code only be as a second check of an already rigorous procedure.

Once the peer review process is complete I will release here detailed instructions on how to get this code working in your centre. However until then feel free to send me an email at mail@simonbiggs.net and I may be able to help you set it up as a second check.
